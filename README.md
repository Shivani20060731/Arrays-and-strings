# Arrays-and-strings

Aim:

To study and implement Arrays and Strings in C++.

Tools Used:

VS Code or Programiz online C++ compiler

Theory

Arrays in C++

An array is used to store multiple values of the same type.

All elements are stored in continuous memory.

Each element is accessed using an index starting from 0.

The size of the array is fixed when created.


Syntax:

data_type array_name[size];

Example:

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};


---

Strings in C++

A string is a group of characters used to store text.

Strings can be created using:

Character arrays

or the string data type from the string library.


Strings are more flexible than arrays and support many operations like:

adding (concatenation)

comparing

finding length, etc.



Syntax:

string name = "Hello";
// or
string name;

Example:

string greeting = "Welcome";
